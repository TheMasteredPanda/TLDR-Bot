Author: TheMasteredPanda (Duke J. Morgan)
Description: A Captcha Gateway System to prevent continuous bot attacks.


Requirements:
    - [DONE] Bot to have ownership over gateway server.
    - [ ] Bot to create more gateway servers if the need arises.
    - [DONE] Each new member to a captcha server will need a dedicated channel to prove they are not a bot.
        * [DONE] In this channel, only they will be able to see themselves and the bot.
        * [DONE] In this channel, the captcha will happen.
        * [DONE] This channel will be removed after a time-to-live if the captcha has not be completed, configuable ofc.
        * [DONE] This channel will be removed after the captcha is successfully on unsuccessfully completed.
    - [DONE] The Bot should allow for invitation links to be generated for each gateway server through a command, accessed on
    the main TLDR guild.
    - [DONE] The Bot should allow for warning announcements if any one gateway is becoming too full.
    - [DONE] After the captcha is complete, the user should be given a one-time invitation link. Once they have joined the
    main TLDR server,
    they should be kicked off of the gateway server.
    - The following data points need to be stored:
        * [ ] Amount of successful captchas.
        * [ ] Amount of unsuccessful captchas.
        * [ ] Amount of joins per month.
    - The following commands need to be written:
        * [DONE] A command to get an invitiation link. This command will also need to accomodate for the different types of
        invitiation link a guild can offer. Whether it be one of or non-expiring.
        * [ ] A command to see the status of each gateway server. How many people join each gateway server,
        it's current lifetime, it's id, &c.
        * [ ] A command to set a channel for useful announcements from this feature. Announcements include:
            - [ ] When a new gateway guild is created.
            - [ ] When a gateway guild is closed.
            - [ ] When a gateway guild will no longer accept new invitations.
            - [ ] When a when a gateway is nearly full.
            - [ ] When a gateway is full.
        * [DONE] A command to add gateway guilds to the list of gateway guilds handled by the bot. This is only for the edgest
        of cases, so I don't think I'll end up doing this.
        * Captchas:
            - Used to determine whether a user is a bot or a human.
            - What will be the captchas?
                * At the moment nobody has a clue, so the basic captchas now will be:
                    * [DONE] Typing out what word has squiggled about in a manner no readable by computers.
